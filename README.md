ABSTRACT
--------
This dissertation studies how Julius Caesar represents himself as an ideal leader in the *Bellum Gallicum*. It argues that Caesar achieves this idealized self-portrait through interactional relationships between the general's mind and his subordinate officers. Chapter 1 analyzes how Caesar communicates with his army and foreigners. In reference to the Greco-Roman literary tradition, Chapter 2 is about the general's mind and the importance that the text gives to his decision-making process. Chapter 3 looks at episodes in which subordinate officers must deliberate for themselves, and how these independent deliberations ultimately demonstrate the brilliance of Caesar's organization of the army and his centrality to it. Considered together, the three chapters demonstrate that Caesar's mind and its manifestation portray Caesar as a uniquely qualified bearer of Roman *imperium*.
